# Internet Superserver Daemon
If we look through the contents of `/etc/services`, we see literally hundreds of different services list.

However, most of these servers would usually be doing nothing but waiting for infrequent connection requests or datagrams.

the `inetd` daemon is designed to eliminate the need to run large numbers of infrequently used servers.
1. a single process - `inetd` monitors a specified set of socket ports and starts other servers as required.
2. the programming of the servers started by `inetd` is simplified, becaused `inetd` performs serveral of the steps.


## design
`inetd` daemon is normally started during system boot.
1. For each of the services specified in the `/etc/inetd.conf`, `inetd` creates a socket of the appropriate type and binds it to the specified port.
2. Using `select` or `epoll` to monitors all of the sockets created in the preceding step.
3. the `select` call blocks untile either a UDP or TCP comes.
4. `inetd` calls `fork` to create a new process that then does an `exec` to start the server program. before `exec`:
   1. close all of the file descriptors inherited from its part, excep the one for the socket on which the UDP datagram is available or the TPC connection has been accepted.
   2. Use the techniques description to duplicate the socket file descriptor on file descriptor 0, 1, 2 and close the socket file descriptor itself.
