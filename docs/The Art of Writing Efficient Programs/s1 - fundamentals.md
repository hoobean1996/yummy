CPU -> CPU frequency -> 
  power consumption: if the frequency trend continued unchanged, CPU would pack more power per square millimeter
    -> number of cores

Efficiency is related to performance, it is not exactly the same.
Efficiency deals with using resources optimally and not wasting them.

## high performance
1. choose the right algorithm
2. using cpu resource effectively
3. using memory effectively
4. avoiding unnecessary computations
5. using concurrency and multi-threading effectively
6. using the programming language effective
7. measuring performance and interpreting results
